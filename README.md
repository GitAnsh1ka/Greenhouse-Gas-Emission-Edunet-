___
Built using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, developed in **Google Colab**.
___
This Project Shows:
* Top 10 Industries by Emission
* Top 10 Substances by Emission
*Distribution of emission factors to understand how common high emissions are

....**using Histograms, Lollipop Chart and Bargraphs**
