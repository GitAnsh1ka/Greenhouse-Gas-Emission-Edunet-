# Project on Greenhouse-Gas-Emission-

This project visualizes **supply chain emission factors** using a real-world dataset. It includes top emission sources by industry and substance, and also shows how emissions are distributed overall.

Built using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, developed in **Google Colab**.

This Project Shows:
-- Top 10 Industries by Emission
-- Top 10 Substances by Emission
--Distribution of emission factors to understand how common high emissions are
....using histograms and bargraphs
